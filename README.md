# **Are classification methods effective at identifying the edibility of mushrooms based on morphology, and which characteristics prove the most influential?**

**Project Summary**

Throughout history, mushrooms have been considered an important food, and foraging for them has become common practice. However, distinguishing between poisonous and edible species can be challenging. Foragers largely rely on field guides, which can be cumbersome due to the myriads of descriptions of different species.

This project explores the feasibility of using machine learning classification methods to identify mushroom edibility and highlight the features which are most important for determining this.

Logistic regression, decision tree, and multi-layer perceptron models were evaluated, with the decision tree and multi-layer perceptron achieving 100% accuracy and precision, and logistic regression achieving 99% accuracy and 100% precision. Odour and spore print colour were revealed as the most important predictors of edibility.

These findings highlight the potential in using classification methods to aid foragers in making decisions about mushroom edibility and provide the most important features to be aware of.

Future work could look to broaden the dataset to include more mushroom species and explore how these methods could be deployed to be of use to foragers in practice.
